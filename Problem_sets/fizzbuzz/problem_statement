## Problem
A classic Data Structures an algorithms problem, you are given an input array of integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). 
You have to write a fizzbuzz function that takes in an input array and iterates over it. When your function receives a number 
that is a factor of 3 you should store 'Fizz' in the output array, if the number is a factor of 5 then you should store 'Buzz' in
the output array. Additionally, if the number is a factor of both 3 and 5, you must store 'FizzBuzz' in the output array. For all other
cases, you must print out the numbers as they are.

Good Luck!
